        <h1>Mastermind</h1>
        <p> Mastermind is a code-breaking game for two players. One player (the codemaker) creates a secret
            code, and the other player (the codebreaker) must guess the code in a set number of turns.
            <br><br>
        </p>
        <p>How to Play:
            <br>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The codemaker secretly selects a 4-color code using a combination of 6 different colors. The colors can
                repeat.</li>
            <li>The codebreaker has 10-12 chances to guess the correct color sequence.</li>
            <li>After each guess, the codemaker provides feedback:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>A red peg indicates a correct color in the correct position.</li>

                <li>A white peg indicates a correct color, but in the wrong position.</li>

                <li>No peg means the guessed color is not part of the code at all.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>The codebreaker continues guessing until they either:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Crack the code by getting all four colors in the correct positions.</li>

                <li>Run out of guesses without solving the code, in which case the game ends, and the codemaker wins.
                </li>

                <li>After the game ends, the option to restart the game is available to try again with a new secret
                    code.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
